# Flutter-Firebase To-Do List Challenge

## Challenge Description

Build a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The tasks should be stored in a Firebase Realtime Database and displayed in a ListView in the app.

### Requirements
- Use Flutter to build the UI for the app, including a form for adding tasks and a ListView for displaying the tasks.

- Use Firebase Realtime Database to store the tasks. Each task should have a unique ID, a title, and a description.

- Implement the ability to add new tasks to the database by submitting the form.

- Implement the ability to edit and delete tasks by tapping on a task in the ListView.
- Use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in to the app.
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions to send a push notification to the user when they add, edit or delete a task.
- The application should be able to handle the case when a user is not logged in, and show a message to login.
- The application should be able to handle the case when the internet is not available, and show a message to the user to check their internet connection.
- The application should be able to handle the case when the database is empty and show a message to the user to add new task.

### Deliverables
- The source code of the application
- A short video demonstrating the app's functionality
- A brief write-up explaining your approach and any challenges you faced.

### Note
This challenge will test the developer's skills in using Flutter and Firebase together, as well as their understanding of Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication and Firebase Cloud Functions. It will also test their ability to handle different edge cases.
